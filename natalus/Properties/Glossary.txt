x series
debug utilities, often parameters matched to some explanation

x00:	selection change state (saved)
		0: none
		1: selection increasing
		2: selection decreasing
		3: selection reset

x10:	current boolean state of "push" toggle
		<bool> state

x20:	geometry change state (saved)
		0: none
		1: geometry added
		2: geometry removed
		3: geometry transformation

s series
information recorded to synchronize active selection between programs

s00:	selection change state. should always bet set to 0, reset when changes are synchronized
		<int> state

s01:	obsolete | updates if illustrator is done parsing incoming selection data

s10:	list of recently selected objects' guids. should always be empty, reset when changes are synchronized
		<string> guid

s11:	safe copy of s10 for illustrator to read from as rhino cleans up

s20:	list of recently deselected objects' guids. should always be empty, reset when changes are synchronized
		<string> guid

s21:	safe copy for s20 for illustrator to read from as rhino cleans up


d series
document attributes like layer names, units, and placement - generally more important to illustrator

d00:	illustrator units x rhino units
		<string> illustrator units | <string> rhino units

d10:	guid of rectangle that represents docbounds in rhino

d11:	guid of previous rectangle if being replaced/overwritten
		<string> guid

d20:	rhino coordinate of top left corner of docbox in model space (coordinate modifier for all geometry translations)
		<float> x | <float> y

d30:	guid of text label
		<string> guid

d01:	illustrator document bounds
		<float> width | <float> height


g series - "the hard part"
information recorded about geometry used to translate between programs

g00:	geometry change state

g10:	guids and properties of geometry being added
		<int> geo type | <string> GUID | <string> layer | <int> spans | [double] coordinates


a series
information recorded about geometry attribute changes

a00:	overall attribute change state

a01:	object-level attribute change states, persistent

a10:	attribute changes being sent from rhino
